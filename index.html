    <h2 id='Description'>Description of the board game of Risk!</h2>

    <p id='opening'><em>Risk! Not just a game, but an art. An art... of war. A place where you can crush enemies and reach heights even Napoleon couldn't have dreamed of. All this and more... on a board game.</em></p>

    <p>But, of course, if you're looking for a more pedantic definition of this game then here it is: Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players. The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of the world, divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents. Turn rotates among players who control armies of playing pieces with which they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls. The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the board and in doing so, eliminate the other players. The game can be lengthy, requiring several hours to finish.</p>

    <h2 id='Rules'>Rules(memorize them!)</h2>

    <p>The rules of Risk! are this(for the classic version): </p>

    <ol>
      <li class='strats'>First, calculate the amount of armies you receive per turn like this: Take the amount of areas of the map you have, and divide them by 3. If the number you get is not an integer, round down to the nearest number. Then, if you own a continent, you get additional troops depending on the bonus that it gives. Add these to your troop count. Voila! <strong>Top Tip: increase the number of areas of the map you own.</strong> </li>  
      <li class='strats'>Next, put the number of armies you receive onto the areas of the map that you hold as per your wishes. This is called troop deployment. <strong>Top Tip: put your troops on areas of the map(or territories) bordering rival territories.</strong></li>  
      <li class='strats'>After you've done that, attack a neighbouring territory by pushing the amount of troops you want to fight with into another territory owned by another player and bordering yours. <strong>Top Tip: push more of your armies into an enemy-owned territory than what the enemy has put on his territory.</strong></li> 
      <li class='strats'><em>To determine who wins, roll 5 dice: 3 for the attacker and 2 for the defender, then compare the numbers that come on the top. If the attacker has rolled a higher number than the defender, then 1 army of the defender is removed from the board, and vice-versa. But, if the number rolled by the defender and the defender are the same, then the defender wins. Example: in the picture above, both of the numbers on the attacking dice are higher than those on the defending dice, so two armies of the defender are removed from the board. Keep on doing this until either all your armies or the defender's armies are removed from the board.</em> If you have only one army left, you must stop attacking while if the defender has no armies left, and you have more than one army left, then you should push your troops into that new territory. That territory is now yours. You can carry out multiple attacks in the same turn.
      <strong>Top Tip: Memorize the italicised rules very carefully, as they are the backbone of Risk! .</strong></li>
      <li class='strats'>Once you have attacked and got new territory, you can send troops from one territory to the other. This is called reinforcement. Beware, you can only do this once per turn.<strong>Top Tip: reinforce weak territories bordering a strong enemy army with strong armies from deep inside your empire. </strong></li>
      <li class='strats'>Keep on following these rules and tips and hopefully you will be able to play a Risk! game successfully.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id='Strategies'>Strategies for winning at Risk!</h2>

    <img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/24/Risk_Game_Graph.svg' height='300' alt='Risk_Game_Graph'>

    <p>Risk is a deeply nuanced game, and there are lots of strategies underneath it that you wouldn't expect. However, if I tell you all of them, then the fun of finding the strategies wouldn't be fun at all. Therefore, I am going to give some tips, but not strategies, as this will keep your interest in this game:</p>

    <ul>
      <li id='continent'>North America is the best continent to hold as it gives five troops per turn, but it only has 3 borders, while Asia is the worst continent to hold, as it gives seven troops but has 4 borders, more than any other continent.</li>
      <li>Always proceed from west to east. First resolve attacks in the Americas and then focus on expanding to the east.</li>
      <li>Never forget the importance of Kamchatka, it is literally the backdoor to Asia. Always try to capture it and hold it.</li>
      <li>Don't occupy Australia from the beginning as it provides very few opportunities to expand.</li>
      <li>If you can, hold Ukraine and the Middle East as they are gateways from Europe and Africa to Asia.</li>
      <li id='firstpoint'>Always attack with more troops than the defender as then you will have more chances of claiming that territory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id='Variants'>Variants(at your own Risk!)</h2>

    <p>Of course, any game as hard to master but easy to learn as Risk! is destined to get its variants as the marketers think that by hyping it they can magically increase its sales. Also, anybody who plays this game will be hungry for more, so, I have put in some links that will guide you to some websites where you can buy and play as many Risk! variants as you want!</p>
